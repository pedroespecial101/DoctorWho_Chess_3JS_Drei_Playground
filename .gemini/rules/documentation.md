# Documentation Search Rules

Always use the **Context7 MCP server** whenever you need to find up-to-date documentation about a framework or library.

## Preferred Library Sources
For this workspace, utilize these specific library IDs in Context7:
- `pmndrs/react-three-fiber`
- `pmndrs/drei`

## Generic Search
For any other documentation, search the Context7 library using the `resolve-library-id` tool before attempting other search methods.
