# Coding Standards

## React Three Fiber
- **Prioritize Drei**: When creating animations, staging scenes, or interacting with the 3D environment, always utilize the utilities and components from the `@react-three/drei` library (e.g., `OrbitControls`, `useGLTF`, `useAnimations`, `Environment`) as much as possible. Avoid implementing these features from scratch using raw Three.js unless absolutely necessary.
